# Classification-of-handwritten-digit-image
The goal of the project is to implement machine learning methods for the task of classiﬁcation. Initially an 
ensemble of four classiﬁers for a given task will be implemented. Then the results of the individual classiﬁers 
are combined to make a ﬁnal decision. The classiﬁcation task will be that of recognizing a 28×28 grayscale 
handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0,1..9. Following four classifiers are used to train on 
MNIST dataset – 

a) Logistic Regression using SGD. 
b) Neural Network. 
c) Random Forest. 
d) Support Vector Machine(SVM).
